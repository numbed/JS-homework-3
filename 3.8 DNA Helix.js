/*

Write a program that prints a DNA helix with length, specified by the user.
The helix has a repeating structure, but the symbol in the chain follows the sequence ATCGTTAGGG.
See the examples for more information.
The input comes as a single string element that must be parsed to a number.
It represents the length of the required helix.
The output is the completed structure, printed on the console.

Input			Output
    4	              	**AT**
                    	*C--G*
                   	T----T
                    	*A--G*
